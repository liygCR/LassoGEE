# LassoGEE
`LassoGEE` is an `R` package for I-CGD algorithm for GEE with L1 regularization in High-Dimension


## Installation
```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("liygCR/LassoGEE/LassoGEE")
```

## Description
Fits generalized estimating equations with L_1 regularization to longitudinal data with high dimensional covariates. Use a efficient iterative composite gradient descent algorithm (I-CGD).
